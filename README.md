Project 2 for CS 413 at NAU

This is a puzzle like game where you click on boxes to move them out of Johns way then you may move him to the other end of the screen to produce a win screen. If you hit a box then a los screen will pop up. At any point you hit the home button on any of the three sub screens it will reset the game entirely
